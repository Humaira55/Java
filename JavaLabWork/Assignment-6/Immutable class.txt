public final class ImmutableClass {
	
	private final String name;
	private final String surname;
	private final int rollno;
	
	ImmutableClass(String name, String surname,int rollno)
	{
		this.name = name;
		this.surname = surname;
		this.rollno = rollno;
	}
	
	void display()
	{
		System.out.println(name + " " + surname + " " +rollno);	
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		ImmutableClass a1 = new ImmutableClass("Humaira","Shaikh",25);
		a1.display();
	}
}

Output : Humaira Shaikh 25

Functionality of Immutable class :

Immutable class in java means that once an object is created, we cannot change its content.

-> The class must be declared as final so that it can not be inherited.
-> Data members in the class must be declared private so that direct access is not allowed.
-> Data members in the class must be declared as final so that we canâ€™t change the value of it after object creation.
