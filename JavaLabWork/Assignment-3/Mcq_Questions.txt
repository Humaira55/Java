Q.1)

d) Compile Time Error

The access modifier of x is private so it can be accessible only within the class where it is being Declared. 
The access modifier of y is protected so it can be accessible only within the same package or in different package who inherits the class of y.
The z is an instance variable which is accessible only within the class.

So it will give the erroe when we try to accesss these variables through test class.


Q.2)

b) 1 2 3

class A
{
	void dis1() {
		System.out.println(1);
	}
}
class B extends A
{
	void dis2() {
		System.out.println(2);
	}
}
class C extends B
{
	void dis3() {
		System.out.println(3);
	}
}
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		C c1 = new C();
		C1.dis1();
		C1.dis2();
		C1.dis3();
	}
}


Q.3)

As java does not support the multiple inheritence.
