Difference between string and StringBuilder :


1)  The object of String is stored in string pool while object of StringBuilder stores in Heap Memory.

2)  String is immutable in java while StringBuilder is mutable in java.

3)  We can use equals method for comparing two strings in java while in StringBuilder we can't use equals method to compare two StringBuilder objects.
	eg: 
	public class check
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			String s1 = "TATA";
			String s2 = "TATA";

			System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));

			StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("TATA");
			StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("TATA");

			System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));
		}
	}

	Output : true
		 false

4)  We can create string object without using new keyword which is not possible with a StringBuilder.
	eg:
	String s1 = "Java";
	StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("Java");

5)  StringBuilder is consumes less memory than a string while performing concatination. This is because string is immutable in java and concatination of two string objects involve creating a new object.
